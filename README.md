## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this plugin require WooCommerce?

Yes, the BRCC Inventory Tracker requires WooCommerce to be installed and activated.

### How does the inventory sync work?

The plugin listens for sales events (like completed orders in WooCommerce or webhooks from Square) and updates inventory accordingly. It also includes scheduled tasks (WP-Cron) to periodically pull data from platforms like Square to catch any missed events.

### Can I manually trigger a sync?

Yes, you can manually trigger an inventory sync from the plugin's dashboard page by clicking the "Sync Now" button.

### Where does the Attendee List data come from?

The Attendee List page combines customer data from completed WooCommerce orders for the selected product and attendee data fetched directly from the mapped Eventbrite event via their API.

### How do I configure the daily email?

The email addresses (`webadmin@jmplaunch.com`, `backroomcomedyclub@gmail.com`) and the timing (daily, for next day's events) are currently hardcoded in the plugin. Future versions may include settings for customization. Ensure your WordPress site can send emails reliably.
